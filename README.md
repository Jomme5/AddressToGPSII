# AddressToGPSII

Specific address search is transformed to gps-coordinates and can accordingly be used by gps -or other aps that have poor address search support.(e.g. Osmand)
Address-search is based on Bing-maps(Microsoft)
The idea is based on Daniel's Barett AddressToGPS that lately has issues concerning look-up. (https://github.com/DanielBarnett714/AddressToGPS)

Platforms: Android

# How to install?

Because of Google tighter security measures; some steps has to be taken for successful installation of apk's.

1. Turn off (temporary) 'play protect' in Google Play Store. I'm not a verified developer in the play-store-ecosphere. The play-protect-feature checks all installation, even those outside Google Play. 

2. You have to give permission to install from 'unknown sources' to the app who ignites the installation (e.g. file-explorer, browser,...)

4. Sometimes you have to uninstall the previous version of the app before you can succesfully install a newer version.

Not taking some or all of these requirements may end up with a revealing error message 'app not installed.'

# How to use?

Type in an address, place or city. You'll get a list of results where you can chose from. A short press on the item, will open up a menu of geographical apps for further processing, a long press on the item will copy the coordinates in to the clipboard.

# Faq:

1. Why not just upload on Google Playstore? For now, I'm not an android-developer, and I don't have the intentions to be one. So a member fee of 25$ to distribute one tiny, free app on the play-store is not an option(unless you give me 25$)

2. But can I trust you? No.

3. Will the app be updated from time to time? If there are interesting suggestions, or there are issues, giving me detailed information(logcat) about the error, things will change.

4. Why not opensource? First, I'm not experienced with github, second the app uses an api-key to gets it information from bingmaps. I donâ€™t want the key to be used by other software without my knowledge.

5. Because of your app I got lost, the rescue team found me after three days. So? No, like much other (free) software, you are fully responsible to use it AS IS. I don't take any responsibility concerning this app and its consequences using it.
