# Update april 2019:

The api-key was publicly accessible due to unsafe communication with server. Because of this, the current API-key will be disabled from 04/10/2019 onward. Apps older than version 1.3 won't work anymore. You can download the latest version under 'release.' Don't forget to uninstall the older version first, before installing the latest app. 
You can get this app also on the playstore for a small fee of 0.6â‚¬/0.7$ In this case you will always have the latest version.


# AddressToGPS II

Specific address search is transformed to gps-coordinates and can accordingly be used by gps -or other aps that have poor address search support.(e.g. Osmand)
Address-search is based on Bing-maps(Microsoft)
The idea is based on Daniel's Barett AddressToGPS that lately has issues concerning look-up. (https://github.com/DanielBarnett714/AddressToGPS)

# How to install?

Because of Google tighter security measures; some steps has to be taken for successful installation of apk's.

1. Turn off (temporary) 'play protect' in Google Play Store. I'm not a verified developer in the play-store-ecosphere. The play-protect-feature checks all installation, even those outside Google Play. 

2. You have to give permission to install from 'unknown sources' to the app who ignites the installation (e.g. file-explorer, browser,...)

4. Sometimes you have to uninstall the previous version of the app before you can succesfully install a newer version.

Not taking some or all of these requirements may end up with a revealing error message 'app not installed.'

# How to use?

Type in an address, place or city. You'll get a list of results where you can chose from. A short press on the item, will open up a menu of geographical apps for further processing, a long press on the item will copy the coordinates in to the clipboard.

# Faq:
1. Will the app be updated from time to time? If there are interesting suggestions, or there are issues, giving me detailed information(logcat) about the error, things will change.

2. Direct or indirect consequences of using this app falls under the responsibility of the user.

# Privacy: 

No personal user-data, usage-data or tracking-data is collected by the app itself. 

# Have fun
