# AddressToGPSII

Specific address search is transformed to gps-coordinates and can accordingly be used by gps -or other aps that have poor address search support.(e.g. Osmand)
Address-search is based on Bing-maps(Microsoft)

Platforms: Android

# How to install?

Because of Google tighter security measures; some steps has to be taken for successful installation of apk's.

1. Turn off (temporary) 'play protect' in Google Play Store. I'm not a verified developer in the play-store-ecosphere. The play-protect-feature checks all installation, even those outside Google Play. 

2. You have to give permission to install from 'unknown sources' to the app who ignites the installation (e.g. file-explorer, browser,...)

4. Sometimes you have to uninstall the previous version of the app before you can have a succesfull installation.

Not taking one of these requirements ends up with a revealing error message 'app not installed.'

# Faq:

1. Why not just upload on Google Playstore? For now, I'm not a android-developer, and don't have the intentions to be one. So an member fee of 25$ to distribute one free app on play-store is not an option(unless you give me 25$)

2. But can I trust you? No.

3. Will the app be updated from time to time? If there are interesting suggestions, or there are issues, giving me detailed information(logcat) about the error, things will change.

4. Why not opensource? First, I'm not experienced with github, second the app uses a api-key to gets it information from bingmaps. I donâ€™t want the key to be used by other software without my knowledge.

5. Because of your app I got lost, after three, they had to rescue me. So? No, like much other (free) software, are you fully responsible to use it AS IS. I don't take any responsibility concerning this app and its consequences using it.
